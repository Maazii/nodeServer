nodejs is a JavaScript runtime framework.

The unique thing about this is that JavaScript here instead of conducting its process inside the browser, runs inside a terminal.

We can start executing JavaScript code inside the terminal by simply going to the console and provide the node command.

They have the .js extension and can be executed by node (name of file).

console.log("") prints to the console.

git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
